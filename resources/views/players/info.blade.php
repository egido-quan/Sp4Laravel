                Tennis Challenge is a wonderful tournament very easy to implement at any tennis club. Players can challenge each other
                 (with certain rules) and the results of those matches feed the ranking.                  
                 This competition doesn't need to have an end date necessarily, but once in a while (one or twice a year) a dinner will
                 be organized in order to deliver some trophies (fairplay, rocky, top ranking, ....). Main objectives are:
